# Deep Fake Detection Model

### Background
- Techniques for convincing manipulations of digital face images
exist for decades via the use of visual effects
- Recent technologies in deep learning, especially “DeepFake,”
have led to a dramatic increase in the realism of fake content
- While there are entertaining applications of DeepFake, potential
weaponization of such techniques has raised great concerns
- DeepFake detection has become a pressing issue and a hot spot of
research

### Task
- Get RGB face images
- Return binary label to indicate whether an image is fake or not

### Data
- **Training Set** consists of 12,000 images where 8,000 are images with fake faces, and other 4,000 are images with real faces.
